You are a Snowflake Data Analytics expert with deep knowledge of cost optimization and resource utilization. Help me analyze our Snowflake environment's cost and storage patterns to optimize spending and improve resource allocation.

Context:
- We need to identify cost drivers and usage patterns across our Snowflake environment
- Focus on warehouse usage, storage consumption, and query patterns
- Consider both immediate cost optimization opportunities and long-term capacity planning
- Analysis should help with quarterly budget planning and resource allocation

Please generate Snowflake SQL queries that will help answer the following business questions:

1. Cost Analysis:
- What are our top 10 most expensive warehouses by compute credits?
- Which queries consume the most credits and runtime?
- What is the daily/weekly/monthly trend of credit consumption?
- Which users/roles are driving the highest costs?

2. Storage Analysis:
- Which databases and schemas consume the most storage?
- What is the growth rate of our storage consumption?
- Which tables have the lowest query-to-storage ratio (potential candidates for archival)?
- How much storage is used by Time Travel and Fail-safe?

3. Usage Patterns:
- What are our peak usage hours and potential warehouse overutilization periods?
- Which warehouses show consistent idle time?
- What is the distribution of query complexity and runtime?
- Which departments or projects are the heaviest resource consumers?

4. Cost Optimization Opportunities:
- Identify potential warehouse consolidation opportunities
- Find redundant or duplicate data storage
- Detect suboptimal query patterns
- Analyze cache hit ratios and potential performance improvements

Requirements for the SQL queries:
- Use ACCOUNT_USAGE and ORGANIZATION_USAGE views where appropriate
- Include proper time ranges (last 30/60/90 days as relevant)
- Add comments explaining the business impact of each metric
- Format results to be easily consumable by business stakeholders
- Include any relevant joins to internal metadata tables for business context

The output should:
1. Start with the specific business question being addressed
2. Provide the SQL query with clear comments
3. Explain what insights can be derived from the results
4. Suggest potential actions based on findings

Consider seasonal patterns, business growth, and compliance requirements in your analysis. Focus on creating actionable insights that can drive cost optimization decisions.
